# VBA_Challenge

Already worked on this project but upon reviewing my XLSX file and attempting to run the VBA script, the actual script in the VBA applications screen was not located. I had to get some advice, you keep learning everyday.

VBA scripting was used to analyze generated stock market data. The script runs a loop through each sheet (each year), analysing the the data and outputting the required information into the new created columns.
